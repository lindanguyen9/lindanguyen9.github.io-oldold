Hi! My name is Linda. I'm a product designer with a focus in user experience research. I have more than 8 years of experience conducting research about human behavior and decision-making. I pair my experience working and doing research in the academic field to advocate for users throughout the design process. My research interests include deception and human motivation, cross-cultural differences, and racial and cognitive bias.
